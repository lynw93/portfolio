# Building A Second-price Bidding Strategy

This is an independent project I worked on for the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program at UC Berkeley.

### **Overview:**
This an interesting project to help a retailer client build their online ad auction strategy.<br>
In this project, I built models for the ad auction and developed an effective algorithm for bidding in a landscape of strategic competitors.<br>
My strategy ranked the top 10%.


### **Code:**
[auction modeling](auction_lastname.py)<br>
[bidder strategy](bidder_lastname.py)<br>
