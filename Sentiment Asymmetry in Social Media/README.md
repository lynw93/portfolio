## Sentiment Asymmetry in Social Media: How Negative Political Content Drives Disproportionate Engagement

This group project was completed as part of DATASCI 203 in the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program at UC Berkeley. Special thanks to our instructor, D. Alex Hughes, for his guidance, feedback, and support.

### **About the Project:**<br>

This study examines the relationship between tweet sentiment and user engagement using 115k tweets from March 2023. <br>
We used Large language models(LLM) to classify tweets by [sentiment](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest) and [topic](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/tweet-topic-base-multilingual). <br><br>
Our analysis primarily focused on linear regression models. Results indicate that tweets with **negative** sentiment generate significantly higher engagement than those with neutral sentiment. This effect is especially pronounced for tweets related to **political topics**, where engagement differences across sentiment levels are even more substantial.<br><br>
These findings suggest that social media ecosystems may inadvertently reward negative political content, potentially fueling information pollution and discourse polarization.
