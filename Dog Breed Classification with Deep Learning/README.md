## Dog Breed Identification - Classifying 120 Dog Breeds

This group project was completed as part of DATASCI 207 in the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program at UC Berkeley.

### **About the Project:**<br>

Identifying dog breeds isn’t just a matter of curiosity for us dog lovers, but also has practical importance for shelters and veterinarians.<br>
In this project, we applied a deep learning approach to this problem, with the overall goal of identifying dog breeds from our dataset. <br><br>
We built a deep learning pipeline to classify 120 dog breeds, addressing high intra-class variation and subtle inter-class differences through custom CNN architecture, strategic data augmentation, and calibrated regularization. We evaluated a series of models of increasing complexity and concluded on the importance of using the right complexity — CNNs for spatial hierarchies and pre-trained models for fine-grained visual distinctions.
