## Sentiment Asymmetry in Social Media: How Negative Political Content Drives Disproportionate Engagement

**About the Project:**<br>
This study examines the relationship between tweet sentiment and user engagement using 115,258 tweets from March 2023. Natural language processing classified tweets by sentiment and topic (politics/other). Linear regression models controlling for follower count and word count reveal that negative political content generates significantly higher engagement (approximately 176 more units) compared to neutral sentiment, while positive political content and non-political content show minimal engagement differences across sentiment levels. These findings suggest social media ecosystems may inadvertently reward negative political content, potentially fueling information pollution and discourse polarization.
