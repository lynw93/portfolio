# Exploratory Data Analysis for Home Features that Provide the Most Value for Renovators

This is a group project I worked on for the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program at UC Berkeley.

### **Overview** <br>
My team and I analyzed 79 attributes influencing home sales prices, focusing on maximizing price per square foot for renovators. <br>
Through data visualization and filtering out less actionable features, we identified three key features that provide the highest value in increasing sales price per square foot.<br>
